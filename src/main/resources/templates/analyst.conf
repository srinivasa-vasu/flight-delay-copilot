Analyze flight delay probability for the following scenario:

Route: %s to %s
Airline ID: %s
Airline Code: %s
Airline Name: %s
Travel Date: %s
Day of Week: %s

Historical Performance:
- Average delay: %.1f minutes
- On-time percentage: %.1f%%
- Total flights analyzed: %d
- Cancellation rate: %.1f%%

Historical Context from Knowledge Base:
%s

Weather Analysis:
%s

Recent Incidents:
%s

Get crew availability using the tools available for the prediction consideration. If crew is unavailable, then calculate the delay and cancellation accordingly.

Based on this data, provide:
1. Delay probability (0-100%%)
2. Expected delay duration if delayed (in minutes)
3. Risk factors (list top 3)
4. Confidence score (0-100%%)
5. Probability of cancellation percentage based on historical inputs
6. Recommendation for travelers

Be specific, data-driven, and provide reasoning based on the given inputs. Format your response as JSON with keys: delayProbability, expectedDelay, riskFactors, confidenceScore, cancellationPercentage, recommendation.
